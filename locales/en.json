During the test network, we will be experimenting with how the Daily Reward Pool is calculated, but it will ideally be automated based on user participation once we move into the Main Ethereum network.",
      "p3":"Every day, we measure your contributions to the network and you receive a “Contribution Score” which can be found in the Contributions section of your wallet. We then calculate how much you contributed to the network relative to the entire community, which determines the percentage of the Daily Reward Pool that you earn.",
      "p4":"It is important to note that with the new system, you will only receive credit for unique interaction, and you can only earn credit from another unique user once per metric per day. (If a friend votes on my content 100 times in a day, I will only get credit for 1 vote). This is critical in preventing gaming and abuse of the system as we move into more valuable token rewards. We are essentially measuring how many unique users you reached in a given day.",

      "onChainP3":"OnChain tokens are stored on the Ethereum public blockchain and are accessible from outside of the Minds platform, which is key for further decentralization.
