## Branch Structure

| Branch    |                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| master    | Approved code ready to merged into the next stable release. All tests should pass and be in a 'ready' state                        |
| stable/*  | Stable builds, inherited from `release/*` branches. Fastlane automatically deploys these builds.                                   |
| test/*    | Release candidate builds, inherited from `release/*` branches. Fastlane automatically deploys these builds.                        |
| release/* | WIP builds. Run `fastlane run increment_version_number` upon creating the branch.                                                  |
| feat/*    | New branches should be made for each Gitlab issue. Merge requests should be opened pointing towards the respective release branch. |

## Platforms

## Install dependencies

- `yarn install`
- `cd ios && pod install` (iOS only)

## Building

- `yarn android` or `yarn ios`

## Testing

## Testing e2e (macOS)

Install the detox cli
- `brew tap wix/brew`
- `brew install applesimutils`
- `yarn global add detox-cli`

Run the tests
- `detox build -c ios.sim.debug`
- `detox test -c ios.sim.debug`

You can use -c ios.sim.release for e2e test a production build

### Custom Release

Once the file is generated in the CI download the apk and run:

`yarn release-json path/file.apk`

This will update the release.json with this version data

Note: You have to update the change-log for the version!

Upload the file to s3 and that is it.
